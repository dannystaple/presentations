![Agent Based Model](anasazi/aa_interface.png)

Note: abm: how it works, how archaeologists use them. problem of abm: noone engages with them; too black-box

---

![games that play themselves](anasazi/simmap.png)

Note: abm games that play themselves, thus our response: insert the human into the game!

---

![simintounity](anasazi/simintounity.png)

Run the simulation _inside_ unity. Turn the player into one agent of many

Note: concept then is to run the simulation inside unity, but use player engagement with the environment and the NPCs to effect change

Note: thus the story of the game is used to subtley convey the design issues of the ABM to the player

---

![Flow](anasazi/Flow.png)

Note: the act of translation of abm into unity, + thinking of how the player engages with ABM when 'immersed' vs when external to the abm (as 'god') reveals serious assumptions and potential flaws in the original model. Important, considering the impact this model has had.

The point of the ABM: to understand the factors behind the cultural collapse.

The point of the game: to understand the same by exploration, discovery, and attempting to _stave off_ the collapse.
