The Lesson?

Typology of Fail

----

## A taxonomy of fails

1 - Technological Failure<br>
2 - Human Failure<br>
3 - Failure as Artifact<br>
4 - Failure as Epistemology<br>
<p class="fragment fade-up">5 - Failing to Reflect</p>

---

## γνῶθι σεαυτόν

- what are the nature of your own fails?
  - reflect on a ‘fail’ that happened this past year.

Where might it fit on the taxonomy?

+ A fail shared is not a failure
+ A fail shared lets us all move forward
+ Githb + Fail Log + DOI means you still are winning
