### How I learned to fail in public and live to tell the tale

I'm so sorry.

---

Psst: Let me tell you a secret: Academics fail *all the time*

Project for today:

+ the parable of Heritage Crowd
+ the Lunatick Moment
  + quite possibly, some other fails too
+ a taxonomy of fails
+ fail & privilege
+ fail gloriously

---

## The parable of heritagecrowd

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>![heritagecrowd](failpics/heritagecrowd.png)</th>
    <th>![blog](failpics/blogreheritagecrowd.png)</th>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## The Lunatick Moment

I found the answer in the community to which I wasn't sure I yet belonged.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>![redemption1](failpics/redemption1.png)</th>
    <th align="top">![redemption2](failpics/redemption2.png)</th>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## The Lesson?

---

## A taxonomy of fails

1 - Technological Failure<br>
2 - Human Failure<br>
3 - Failure as Artifact<br>
4 - Failure as Epistemology<br>
<p class="fragment fade-up">5 - Failing to Reflect</p>

---

## γνῶθι σεαυτόν

- what are the nature of your own fails?
  - reflect on a ‘fail’ that happened this past year.

Where might it fit on the taxonomy?

## a fail shared is not a failure

But failing in public can be a function of privilege

---

## so professors: make it safe to fail

## students: swing for the bleachers!

Note:
+ A fail shared is not a failure
+ A fail shared lets us all move forward
+ Githb + Fail Log + DOI means you still are winning

Note:
Sharing my fails in public has led to more opportunities for me than I could ever have imagined.
