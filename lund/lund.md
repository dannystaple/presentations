Note:
synesthesia- ' stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.'
Have never experienced it, I think; although once was Bish organist; had to think of what I was playing as shapes in order to make everything work.

## A digital synesthesia: 
### using and abusing sonification for hearing patterns in archaeological data

Note:
But working with digital stuff, ephemeral stuff, electromagnetic pulses, I've been wondering if I can induce a kind of synesthesia, expand what's possible to do, to think with, to experience and understand. Probably would be easier if I just did drugs.

### How to Deal with Big Data Gothic?

![](lund/gandalf-you-shall-deal-with-it.jpg)

Note:
- big data in its archaeo variants
- we used to just call this 'black box'
- big data's negative feedback loops that no one can challenge, and that remove humans from the equations (oh the algorithm did this!) hiding and obscuring the choices and biases encoded.
-medium-ish data using big data tools

---

### poverty of assumptions

![](lund/xkcd.jpg)

Note:
-measure what's easy to measure; most big data applications do not have the kind of rich data like Baseball or google search, or the ability to learn from mistakes
-eg MATRIX at GCU; washington schools that culled teachers based on bad test scores compared to previous years. Firing of teachers seen as proof that the system worked. Or: people who live in place x are bad credit risk. How do you determine bad credit risk? Well, living in place x would do it!
-negative feedback loops

### poverty of visualizations

![](lund/viz.png)

Note:
- despite wonderful things like D3 & data driven documents, we're still riding the horseless carriage to the digital revolution
- still privileging the screen
- remember how left/right top/bottom privileges readings of visual data

### digital synaesthesia: big dada?

[Handbook of Sonification, chp 8](http://sonification.de/handbook/index.php/chapters/chapter8/) versus
[Sonic Word Clouds](https://danielruten.wordpress.com/2017/04/15/sonic-word-cloud-project-part-4-conclusions/)

![](lund/Man_Ray,_Rencontre_dans_la_porte_tournante.jpg)

Note:
- nb shawn play this in safari rather than chrome
- sonification - the chp 8 paramater mapping /audiofication kind of thing
- contrast with sonic word clouds
- latter has an emotional content; an emotional intensifier
- similar maybe to the sound-poems of the dada-ists which focuses on phonemes rather than semantic value
- video games & recent press on VR as empathy machines
- returns humans into the data
- a performance of the data rather than its representation

### historical friction

Digital data hurts

[![friction](lund/friction.png)](https://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cbhF2QXa21)

Note:
-  works on safari still though
- an inspiration to the voices recognition app
- a way of making haptic - it really hurts the ears! - the digital data that permeates the air, a way of sensing the digital aether.
- not really 'digital synesthesia' though, if we mean translating one sense to another

### watling street

Listen to Watling Street

[![Watling](uclbigdatagothic/watling.png)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vv0oswpr18o)

Note:
- have a listen
- contrast with a map of coin hoards, coin data
- what do we now understand that's different? [steal some of my heritage jam writeup here]

### bad equity

[![song](lund/song.png)](https://soundcloud.com/shawn-graham-60451318/bad-equity)

Note:
- here, listening for errors: sonification as a way to figure out what's missing in the data?

(I note also the existence of [midi.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js) which comes with a colour-to-note mapper, [synesthesia.js](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/blob/master/js/midi/synesthesia.js) which I haven't tried yet.)

Note:
- those are fun; but let's try something else, let's sonify some archaeometric data
- show the table; have some kind of plot for both cat order vs chrono order
- note that we're sonifying the 3 strongest signals in the data; normally, we don't bother because they overwhelm everything else
- contrast catalogue order versus chronological order
- they both demonstrate interesting things about the data; knowing the underlying progression helps to understand what we're hearing
- chrono order becomes cleaner by the end, hearing the change in composition (normally, quartz, haemetite, and augite are so common that that data gets thrown out!)

### some issues in sonification for archae

![](lund/Annoying-noise-001.jpg)

Note:
- temporality, timescale of the listen versus timescale of the event -> but maybe the latter is an intensifier
- parameter mapping. which parameters do we map? should there be a standard grammar? contrast chp 8, return to the performance vs representation issue again.

---

### going further

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>![](lund/stairbikes.png)</th>
    <th>![](lund/haptic.png)</th>
    </tr>
    </table>

Note:
- aggregate image data into sound; sound into touch
- the way to confront big data is to expose the man behind the curtain, to show up its absurdities, to take away the magic of the black box. digital synesthesia achieves this by using the tools of computation to turn data into literal performance. at the same time, it returns an emotional connection to this data, to remind us that this data is *always* a proxy for human lives lived.

---

### Digital Synesthesia?

to conlude, these are things to work out:

- appropriate parameters for mapping archaeological data to sound
- appropriate scales for duration of the piece, duration of the notes
- timbre, instrumentation, emotional valence
- performance versus representation
- and when to say 'to hell with it'
