# Big Data Gothic

![by Sophie Hay](sophie-hay.jpg)

####[The Gothic] aimed to produce emotionally vertiginous shocks and thrills;<br> sensations of any kind, in fact, so long as they put the viewing subject - the 'Self' - at the centre of the experience.
<br>
#### -> Richard Marggraf Turley

#### "The goal<br> was to <br>overwhelm <br>the senses,<br> to annihilate<br> 'Self'."

#### The world of information is more Gothic <br>than its believers believe, <br>because it is ghostly, <br>silhouette-like, <br>deprived of human sentience

### Techno-utopianism & the obliteration of self

Note:
the idea that more metrics results in better outcomes for the privileged few who live outside the algorithm, the people who own uber rather than drive for uber, or the sessional adjuncts at a former university I taught at who were scored across something called 'the Matrix' which was used to figure out who got to keep their job. Zoe Quinn: If you're not asking yourself "how could this be used to hurt someone" in your design/engineering process, you've failed. And it's not you paying for your failure. It's people who already have enough shit to deal with.

### The sublime ... er big data ... will save us
But probably not you, personally.

Note:
Kurzweil, obviously. painting: Martin Myrone encourages us to think of artistic engagement with, and deployment of, the sublime as primarily market driven, thus categorising it as a somewhat knowing and cynical enterprise. ‘The reality of commercial spectacle and sensation,’ he states, "was accommodated to a revised notion of ideal art through the eighteenth century notion of the sublime, the aesthetic celebration of grandeur and horror for its stimulation effects ... By the late eighteenth century the term had become commonplace with improvised, informal and often half-baked writing that then passed as art criticism, where it typically functioned as a ‘buzzword’ that had a certain currency without being fully theorized." He concludes that the sublime can ‘probably best be described as a certain kind of effect which had more to do with manipulating public and critical response than with attending to some pre-ordained theoretical prescription.’ http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/christine-riding-shipwreck-self-preservation-and-the-sublime-r1133015

## Big Data Gothic
+ sublimates the human
+ revels in the glory of the [data] landscape
+ exults in the terror of it all

<br><br>"It's a lot more complicated than that--"<br><br>

"No. It ain't. When people say things are a lot more <br>
complicated than that, they means they're getting worried <br>
that they won't like the truth. People as things, <br>
that's where it starts."<br><br>

"Oh, I'm sure there are worse crimes--"<br><br>

"But they starts with thinking about people as things..."<br><br>

Big data, like the Gothic, lacks context.

Context forces us to _not_ think of humans as things

Note:
Like the sublime, we get caught up in the seductive mass of the numbers.

### Big Data Macabre:
#### Buying and Selling Human Remains on Instagram
(project lead: Damien Huffer)

![img](bonetradesampler.png)
Note:
Big data from culling the posts gives me some insight, esp when I represent as vector models, some of the explicit language behind this trade, and ways that people signal that something is for sale. But it also misses the visual signals in the composition of the images itself. For that, I have to go in and read these hidden cues - rather like a kind of steganography that is explicitly meant to conceal the trade from algorithmic monitoring. This kind of reaction is also present on Facebook or Twitter as people 'template' themselves for particular audiences. The danger is that these templated selves could become algorithmic prisons: our performances in reaction to alogorithms that make assumptions about how the world work cease to become performances and instead become real. This is big data gothic.

### Thick Data and the Fall of the House of Nokia

"They put a higher value on quantitative data, they didn't know how to handle data that wasn't easily measurable, and that didn't show up in existing reports. What could've been their competitive intelligence ended up being their eventual downfall." - [Tricia Wang](https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7#.6docngys8)

Complementary; Digital Humanities & Big Data balance each other

"People are getting caught up on the quantity side of the equation rather than the quality of the [...] insights that analytics can unearth". - Steve Maxwell
