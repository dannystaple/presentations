## The Plan for Today:

1. cite your software: what is your research environment? What is your workflow?
2. digital notebook management
3. citation management
4. bibliometric analysis

---

## take two minutes to consider: what is your workflow?

+ how do you write?
+ where do you make your notes?
+ what software do you _own_ versus _rent_?
+ are you the user or are you the product?
+ what software do you _need_ to achieve your research?
+ do you have a strategy for backing things up?
+ do you have a strategy for versioning?

_if there are ideas on this list that are foreign to you, we're here to help_

## software sustainability

---

## Control you notes.

Dual-entry notekeeping with Scrivener

(free to try, $40ish)

---

## There are other good notebook solutions.

A simple text editor and a citation manager are all you really need: futureproof!

**CONTROL** your own notes.

---

## Futureproof?

+ Keep it simple, students.
+ text files will always be readable and unlockable and importable
+ Use things like `#` to indicate headings
+ Use things like `_` to indicate italics .... etc.
+ `save as` and change `.txt` to `.md` and you're writing in markdown

---

## markdown?

+ markdown can be turned into beautiful pdfs, html, doc, epub etc using the free `pandoc` utility at [pandoc.org](http://pandoc.org/)

## I wrote this web presentation as a text file:

## Backing up

You use dropbox? That's fine. But it'd be better if you controlled your own data.

## Versioning?

![](Octocat.png)

Versioning is backing up so that you can rewind what the @#$%^ you did to your file

- no more `thesis.doc` ... `thesis1.doc`....`thesis1-final.doc`...`thesis-final-w-edits.doc`...`thesis1-with-final-edits.doc`...`finalthesisithink.doc`

- uses a piece of software called 'git' to take snapshots of your files.
- can be a bit tricky. Talk to me if interested

## bibliometric Analysis

- once you have a bibliography put together, you can begin to do some curious things indeed...
