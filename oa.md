The great shame of archaeology: no one ever resuses the primary data. 

That contest is our attempt at trying to rectify that.

I know the shame of having files that nobody will ever see.

---

Of sitting on data that might - somehow - in ways I can't quite imagine yet - be useful to somebody else.
