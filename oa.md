+ in my teaching

+ in my research

+ in my daily use of tech

+ in my failures

But first, a video.

The great shame of archaeology: no one ever resuses the primary data. 

That contest is our attempt at trying to rectify that.

---

I know the shame of having files that nobody will ever see.

---

Of sitting on data that might <br>- somehow - <br>- in ways I can't quite imagine yet - <br>be useful to somebody else.

I made darn sure that people could find my written stuff.

...which I plumbed into Scopus, into Figshare, into Google Scholar. <br><br>If it plumbs together, I plumbed it good.

Note: the thing about doing that is that you quickly get a sense of which of your works people actually read. And how they read it. Certain of my papers I've discovered are useful literature review padding. Note also- I've committed to stop reviewing for Elsevier owned journals. This is not without personal cost.

## what about teaching?

---

+ haven't ordered a textbook once, in six years at Carleton, for any of my classes
+ *every* class uses resources that can be had from the open web or from the library

---
<section data-background="craftingbook.png">
<h2 style="color:black" align="right">I even wrote my own damn open access workbook for one class that needed it.</h2>
</section>
---
+ students are encouraged to take copies of it 
+ some students even re-wrote parts of it

## what about research?

---
+ What is it, _exactly_ that I actually do?

Note: you can be really open in your practice if you tweet every bloody thought that comes into your head, as I do.

## expanding the space
![](smiths.png)

---
## So. About Shawn.
+ trying to make OA and Open Source a habit of mind
  + for my self
  + for my students
  + my colleagues
---
+ trying to expand the possibility space for what we do
  + places we publish
  + what 'publishing' might mean
  + that data is itself publishable

### this is necessarily political

<br> & 
<br>failing in public</h2>

Note:
and I'm a white guy on the internet.
if I want others to try this even a little bit, I have to go big. I gotta make it safe to try stuff, safe to fail. I have to figure out what works and what doesn't, because other people are not in a position to make mistakes. They have to get it right the first time.
